****`Pain001`**** is a Python Library that allow users to create ISO
20022-compliant payment files directly from CSV in a simple and easy
way.

**[ISO 20022][1]** is a standard for sharing financial information
across organizations globally. It is used by banks and other financial
institutions to automate and standardize payment transactions.

Payments usually begin with a ****`Pain001`**** payment initiation
messages that are sent by the payer to the payee (or the payee's bank)
via a secure network such as SWIFT or SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)
network or other payment networks such as CHAPS, BACS, Faster Payments,
etc. The message contains the payer's and payee's bank account details,
payment amount, and other information required to process the payment.

**`Pain001`** can help to reduce complexity and costs associated with
payment processing by providing a simple and easy way to create ISO
20022-compliant payment files. This can save time and money by
eliminating the need to manually create and validate payment files. This
can help to reduce the risk of errors and ensure that payments are
processed correctly.

If you are looking for a way to simplify and automate your payment
processing, **`Pain001`** is a great option. It is a powerful tool that can
help you to save time, money, and improve accuracy.

## Payment Messages

The following **ISO 20022 Payment Initiation message types** are
currently supported:

- **[pain.001.001.03](/pain.001.001.03/)** - Customer Credit Transfer Initiation

This message is used to transmit credit transfer instructions from the
originator (the party initiating the payment) to the originator's bank.
The message supports both bulk and single payment instructions, allowing
for the transmission of multiple payments in a batch or individual
payments separately. The pain.001.001.03 message format is part of the
ISO 20022 standard and is commonly used for SEPA Credit Transfers within
the Single Euro Payments Area. It includes relevant information such as
the originator's and beneficiary's details, payment amounts, payment
references, and other transaction-related information required for
processing the credit transfers.

- **[pain.001.001.09](/pain.001.001.09/)** - Customer Credit Transfer Initiation

This message format is part of the ISO 20022 standard and is commonly
used for SEPA Credit Transfers within the Single Euro Payments Area. It
enables the transmission of credit transfer instructions from the
originator to the originator's bank. The message includes essential
information such as the originator's and beneficiary's details, payment
amounts, payment references, and other transaction-related information
required for processing the credit transfers.
