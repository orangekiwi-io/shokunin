<div class="container-fluid p-0">

Simplify and streamline your payment processing with Pain001, a powerful
Python library that enables you to create ISO 20022-compliant payment
files directly from CSV data.

**[ISO 20022][1]** is a global standard for sharing financial
information across organizations. It provides an harmonized protocol
used by banks, corporations, and financial institutions to automate
and standardise payment transactions. **Pain001** focuses specifically
on payment initiation messages, commonly known as pain.001 payment
initiation messages.

Typically, a payment journey commences with a pain001 payment that is
sent by the payer to the payee (or the payee's bank) via a secure
network such as SWIFT or SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) network or
other payment networks such as CHAPS, BACS, Faster Payments, etc.
The message contains the payer's and payee's bank account details,
payment amount, and other information required to process the payment.

**Pain001** offers a streamlined solution for reducing complexity and
costs associated with payment processing. By providing a simple and
efficient method to create ISO 20022-compliant payment files, it
eliminates the manual effort of file creation and validation. This not
only saves valuable time and resources but also minimizes the risk of
errors, ensuring accurate and seamless payment processing.

If you are seeking to simplify and automate your payment processing,
consider leveraging the capabilities of **Pain001**.

## Payment Messages

The following **ISO 20022 Payment Initiation message types** are
currently supported:

- **[pain.001.001.03](/pain.001.001.03/)** - Customer Credit Transfer Initiation

This message is used to transmit credit transfer instructions from the
originator (the party initiating the payment) to the originator's bank.
The message supports both bulk and single payment instructions, allowing
for the transmission of multiple payments in a batch or individual
payments separately. The pain.001.001.03 message format is part of the
ISO 20022 standard and is commonly used for SEPA Credit Transfers within
the Single Euro Payments Area. It includes relevant information such as
the originator's and beneficiary's details, payment amounts, payment
references, and other transaction-related information required for
processing the credit transfers.

- **[pain.001.001.09](/pain.001.001.09/)** - Customer Credit Transfer Initiation

This message format is part of the ISO 20022 standard and is commonly
used for SEPA Credit Transfers within the Single Euro Payments Area. It
enables the transmission of credit transfer instructions from the
originator to the originator's bank. The message includes essential
information such as the originator's and beneficiary's details, payment
amounts, payment references, and other transaction-related information
required for processing the credit transfers.
