## Overview

Shokunin (ËÅ∑‰∫∫) is a highly-optimized, Rust-based static site generator (ssg) that provides an easy-to-use and powerful tool for building professional static websites and blogs. Shokunin enables you to generate static HTML files from Markdown, YAML, JSON, and TOML. You can also use HTML themes and custom templates to create websites quickly and easily.

## Features

Blazing fast and flexible, Shokunin is the perfect tool for anyone looking to build a professional website. It's easy to use and written in Rust ü¶Ä, which means it's both fast and reliable. The library supports multiple content formats, like Markdown, YAML, JSON, and TOML. You can also use HTML themes and Premium templates to create accessible websites quickly and efficiently. Shokunin even generates minified HTML and JSON versions for optimal performance and comes with a built-in Rust development server with live reloading.

## Benefits

Static site generators like Shokunin offer several benefits over dynamic websites. For one, static sites are much faster and more secure than their dynamic counterparts. With a static site generator, you can generate a site quickly and easily without the need for a server-side language like PHP or JavaScript. It makes static sites perfect for blogs, portfolios, and other types of content that don't require dynamic features like user accounts or e-commerce. Another benefit of static sites is that they're more reliable and easier to deploy. Because static sites are generated ahead of time, there's no risk of a database outage or other server-related issues. Your site will be available 24/7 and won't go down due to a server problem.

## Licenses

Shokunin is licensed under the terms of both the MIT license and the Apache License (Version 2.0). This means you're free to use, modify, and distribute the software as long as you comply with the terms of both licenses. The MIT License is one of the most permissive open source licenses available, while the Apache License is a more comprehensive license that includes patent protection and other legal provisions. Together, these licenses provide a solid legal framework for using and distributing Shokunin in your own projects.
